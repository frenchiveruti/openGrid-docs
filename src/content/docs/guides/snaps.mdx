The snap system is the foundation of OpenGrid - these are the connection points that attach accessories to your board. Snaps slide into the board's 28mm grid holes and hold your accessories securely in place.

## Board Compatibility

OpenGrid supports two board types:

**Full Board (6.8mm thick)** - Works with all full-thickness snaps and requires mounting snaps for wall attachment. Best for heavy-duty applications.

**Lite Board (4mm thick)** - Uses lite versions of snaps (3.4mm thick) and has built-in screw holes for direct mounting. Ideal for lightweight applications and space-saving.

# Types

## Mounting Snap

Specifically designed for attaching your OpenGrid board to walls or surfaces using countersunk screws. Required for full-thickness boards, while lite boards have built-in screw holes.

**When to use:** For mounting full boards to walls or when additional support points are needed.

**Installation:** Push into grid hole, insert screw through center, and attach to wall.

## Bare Snap

The basic building block for creating your own accessories. These simple snaps provide a foundation for custom designs and light-duty applications.

**When to use:** For lightweight accessories, temporary mounting, or as a base for custom designs.

**Installation:** Simply push into board's grid holes until they click into place.

## Directional Snap

A stronger version of the bare snap that locks in one direction. Features three flexible sides and one rigid side marked with an arrow pointing upward.

**When to use:** For accessories that need extra holding strength or face directional forces.

**Installation:** Push the arrow-marked side in first (upper part), then snap the lower part into place. The upper part won't move out easily when force is applied from behind.

**Removal:** Apply pressure to the lower part from behind - avoid pushing on the upper arrow-marked section.

## Lock Snap

A print-in-place snap with a rotating mechanism that locks firmly into the board. Features a coin slot on top for easy rotation and visual indication of lock status.

**When to use:** For heavy accessories or when you need maximum holding strength without directional bias.

**How it works:** 
- Insert like any other snap when in open position
- Rotate the inner mechanism using the coin slot to lock in place
- The snap expands outward, gripping the board tightly
- Rotate back to unlock and remove

**Installation:** Push into grid hole while in open position, then rotate inner mechanism to lock.

**Removal:** Rotate inner mechanism to unlock position, then remove normally.

## Multiconnect Snap

Compatible with the Multiconnect ecosystem, allowing you to use Multiconnect accessories on your OpenGrid board.

**Available versions:**
- **Standard Multiconnect Snap** - Basic multiconnect compatibility
- **Directional Multiconnect Snap** - Combines directional locking with multiconnect threading
- **Lock Multiconnect Snap** - Tighten screw to expand and lock in place, overtighten slightly to engage locking mechanism

**When to use:** When you want to use existing Multiconnect accessories on your OpenGrid system.

**Installation:** Push snap into grid hole, then screw in Multiconnect accessory using standard threading.

## Quick Tips

**Installation:** All snaps simply push into the board's grid holes until they click into place.

**Removal:** Use a thin tool (like a screwdriver) to push from the back side. For accessories with multiple snaps, remove one accessory first, then use it to help remove other snaps.

**Print Settings:** All snaps are designed to print without supports. Lock snaps print in place with no assembly required.

**Material Choice:** PLA works for most applications, but PETG or ABS may provide better durability for high-stress uses.
